## What Users Can Use It For

Our AI-powered system helps users:

- **Discover high-potential BNB Smart Chain meme coins early** - before major price surges, giving retail investors a critical edge in the BSC ecosystem.
- **Automate BNB token monitoring** - eliminating the need to manually scan Telegram, Twitter, DEXs, and trackers across the BNB Smart Chain ecosystem.
- **Filter scams and rugpulls** - using behavioral and on-chain analysis to detect red flags on BSC, making trading safer.
- **Identify real community momentum** - distinguishing organic growth from paid shills or bot activity in the BNB ecosystem.
- **Level the playing field** - by reducing information asymmetry traditionally exploited by insiders, whales, and snipers.
- **Enter earlier for maximum ROI** - ensuring users don't miss the small window of explosive growth most meme coins experience early on.
- **Voice-enabled AI interaction** - use natural speech to query markets, get analysis, and receive trading insights hands-free.
- **BNB Smart Chain analysis** - leverage specialized AI understanding of BSC's architecture for deeper insights.
- **Free intelligence access** - unlimited access to all features without payment barriers.

## How Memecoins Are Analyzed

Sniffle uses a multi-stage, AI-powered process to analyze BNB Smart Chain memecoins:

1. **Data Collection**
   - Scrapes fresh token data (price, volume, liquidity, age, market cap, etc.) from the BNB Smart Chain.
   - Gathers recent tweets and social sentiment for each token.

2. **Risk Factor Calculation**
   - Calculates several risk factors for each token:
     - **Liquidity Risk:** Low liquidity increases risk.
     - **Volatility Risk:** Extreme price swings are riskier.
     - **Age Risk:** Newer tokens are generally riskier.
     - **Volume Risk:** Low trading volume signals higher risk.
   - Each factor is scored (0–5), then summed for a total raw risk score.

3. **Normalization & Peer Comparison**
   - Risk scores are normalized relative to all analyzed memecoins, ensuring meaningful comparisons.
   - Investment potential is also rated based on multiple signals.

4. **Output & Filtering**
   - Each token receives a final risk score (0–10), an investment potential score, and a rationale.
   - Only tokens with complete data are included in recommendations.

5. **Database & Recommendations**
   - Analysis results are stored and updated regularly.
   - The AI only provides recommendations for tokens in its analyzed memecoin database.

This process ensures transparent, explainable, and up-to-date analysis for BNB Smart Chain memecoins, helping users make informed decisions.

## How It Improves the Status Quo

Traditional methods of discovering meme coins on BNB Smart Chain have major flaws:

- Discovering tokens **after** the pump = missed profits  
- **Manual research** across BSC DEXs wastes time and is error-prone  
- Hard to tell a **genuine project** from a scam in the rapidly evolving BSC ecosystem  
- **Insiders and bots** always move first on new BEP-20 tokens  
- Most tools can't separate **real hype from fake** in the BNB community  
- Retail traders often miss the **early-entry sweet spot** in the fast-growing BSC ecosystem  
- **No specialized tools** for analyzing BEP-20 smart contracts and BSC-specific token mechanics
- **Expensive subscriptions** that don't deliver consistent value

Our system solves all of this with **free access** and **professional-grade AI memecoin intelligence**.
